## The more you know
```
    Before Understanding Data structure
    we have Complexities. There are two types:
```
# Time Complexity
```
Refers to the measurement of how much time was elapsed or 
has been taken in order for the code to execute.
```
# Space Complexity
```
Space required to execute the functionality SUCCESSFULLY.
```

## Comclusion if TIME Complexity is the same as 
## Time execution. 

```
NO, This varies from machine to machine due to network load.
```

# So What the fuck is Time complexity
```
We found out that it is not the time elapsed for each code 
to execute, but the number of times each statement executes.
```

**I don't know how this shit is relevant but I,definitely,will**
